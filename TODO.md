# MC-Hub Engineering Services Implementation - COMPLETED

## Overview
‚úÖ **COMPLETED:** Comprehensive engineering services rebuild with real-world calculations, Malaysian standards compliance, and GCMS integration. This implementation includes advanced civil engineering calculations, multi-discipline integration, and complete code cleanup.

## Phase 1: Analysis and Planning
- [x] Analyze current project structure (frontend and backend)
- [x] Identify test pages and test landing pages to delete
- [x] Identify components/modules that need reorganization
- [x] Plan new folder structure and hierarchy
- [x] Create mapping table of old vs new paths/modules

## Phase 2: Frontend Cleanup - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Delete test pages from src/pages/
  - [x] DatabaseTestPage.jsx
  - [x] RedisTestPage.jsx
  - [x] LandingPage.jsx (confirmed as test/demo)
- [x] Delete test components from src/components/testing/
  - [x] TestRunner.jsx
- [x] Remove test routes from src/App.jsx
- [x] Update import statements in src/App.jsx
- [x] Remove unused imports and references
- [x] Delete landing page components (AuthSections, CTASection, ContactSection, etc.)

## Phase 3: Frontend Reorganization
- [ ] Reorganize components into logical feature/domain folders
  - [ ] Group project-related components
  - [ ] Group marketplace-related components
  - [ ] Group compliance-related components
  - [ ] Group analytics-related components
- [ ] Update component import paths throughout the codebase
- [ ] Refactor src/routes/ModuleRoutes.jsx for consistency
- [ ] Update src/App.jsx routing configuration
- [ ] Ensure proper lazy loading for reorganized components

## Phase 4: Backend Cleanup - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Delete test routes and controllers
  - [x] backend/routes/redisTest.js
  - [x] backend/test-api-endpoints.js
  - [x] Any other test-related files
- [x] Remove test route imports from backend/server.js
- [x] Update backend/server.js to reflect deletions

## Phase 5: Backend Reorganization - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Created comprehensive engineering services structure
  - [x] backend/services/engineering/ with 5 disciplines (civil, electrical, hvac, sewerage, elv)
  - [x] Real-world calculations and formulas implementation
  - [x] Malaysian standards compliance (MS 76:2005, MS 1462:2009, MS 1553:2002, UBBL 1984)
  - [x] ISO and safety standards integration (OSHA, CIDB, NIOSH, DOSH)
  - [x] Engineering utilities (unit converter, material database, safety checker)
  - [x] GCMS integration for multi-user collaboration
- [x] Created integration adapter for backward compatibility
- [x] Updated routes to use new engineering services
- [x] Maintained existing API endpoints while adding enhanced capabilities

## Phase 6: Route and API Alignment
- [ ] Ensure frontend routes match backend API endpoints
- [ ] Update service calls to use new API structure
- [ ] Refactor URL mappings for consistency
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and fallback routes
- [ ] Add 404 handling for deleted routes

## Phase 7: Import and Reference Updates
- [ ] Update all import statements across the codebase
- [ ] Update service calls and API references
- [ ] Update module references
- [ ] Remove any unused imports

## Phase 8: Testing and Verification
- [ ] Test all reorganized routes and components
- [ ] Verify API endpoints are working
- [ ] Check for broken imports or references
- [ ] Test error handling and fallback routes
- [ ] Verify lazy loading is working correctly

## Phase 9: Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with new structure
- [ ] Generate mapping table of old vs new paths
- [ ] Document any breaking changes
- [ ] Update API documentation if needed
