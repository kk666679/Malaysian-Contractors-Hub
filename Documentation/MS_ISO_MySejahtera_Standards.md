# Malaysian Standard (MS), ISO Building Codes, and MySejahtera Contractor Requirements

## Malaysian Standard (MS) and ISO Building Codes
- **Malaysian Standards (MS):** These are developed through consensus by committees representing various stakeholders. The Department of Standards Malaysia (DSM) is the national standards body and a member of ISO. While a comprehensive list of all MS building codes was not retrieved, specific standards like MS 1936 (Electrical Installations of Buildings) and MS 1979 (Electrical Installations of Buildings) are available.
- **ISO Building Codes:** Malaysia adheres to internationally recognized standards, including ISO 9001 for quality management and ISO 14001 for environmental management. The construction industry is also moving towards adopting ISO standards, with CIDB receiving ISO/IEC 17024:2012 certification.
- **Integration:** The app will need to incorporate relevant MS and ISO standards into its pre-configured templates and provide a mechanism for automatic updates as new standards are released or existing ones are revised.

## MySejahtera Contractor Health and Safety Compliance
- **MySejahtera:** This app was initially developed for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. While there is no specific "MySejahtera Contractor" app, the principles of health and safety compliance remain relevant.
- **Contractor Compliance:** Contractors are required to adhere to occupational safety and health (OSH) policies. This includes managing visitor entry to premises, collecting health and safety documentation, and ensuring compliance with regulations set by the Department of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH).
- **App Integration:** The app will integrate a health and safety compliance module that allows contractors to manage OSH documentation, track compliance with relevant regulations, and generate checklists for safety inspections. This will help ensure that contractors maintain a safe working environment in line with Malaysian health and safety standards.
