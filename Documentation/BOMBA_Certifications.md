# BOMBA Certifications and Fire Protection in Malaysia

Fire protection and safety in Malaysia are primarily governed by the Fire and Rescue Department of Malaysia (BOMBA) and regulated through legislation such as the Fire Services Act 1988 and the Uniform Building By-Laws (UBBL) 1984.

## BOMBA Certification:
- **Purpose:** BOMBA certification ensures that buildings and facilities comply with Malaysia's fire safety standards. This includes the planning, installation, repair, refurbishment, and preventive maintenance of fire protection systems.
- **Fire Certificate (FC):** New buildings, after obtaining a Certificate of Completion and Compliance (CCC), must acquire a Fire Certificate from BOMBA. This certificate confirms that the building meets the necessary fire safety requirements.
- **Material Certification:** All fire safety installations and materials used in premises must have a Material Certification Certificate issued by BOMBA.
- **Process:** The certification process typically involves inspections by BOMBA, ensuring that fire fighting access, fire alarm systems, sprinklers, fire extinguishers, fire lifts, and emergency exits with fire doors are in place and functional.

## Key Regulations and Standards:
- **Fire Services Act 1988 (Act 341):** This Act empowers BOMBA to enforce fire safety regulations, including the prevention, extinguishing, and control of fires, and the protection of life and property.
- **Uniform Building By-Laws (UBBL) 1984:** Part VIII of the UBBL specifically focuses on fire alarm and fire extinguishment systems. It outlines detailed requirements for fire safety installations in buildings, including high-rise structures.
- **Malaysian Standards (MS):** Specific Malaysian Standards related to fire safety, such as those for carbon dioxide extinguishing systems and gaseous fire extinguishing systems, also apply.

## App Integration:
For the app, the Compliance Tracker module will include a checklist generator for BOMBA certifications. This will help contractors ensure that their projects meet the necessary fire safety requirements, track compliance with BOMBA regulations, and prepare for inspections and certification processes. The app will also highlight the importance of using BOMBA-certified materials and installations.
