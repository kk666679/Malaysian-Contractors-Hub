## Important Considerations for the App:
- **Dynamic Data:** Labor rates can fluctuate due to various factors (e.g., demand, foreign worker policies, economic conditions). The app should ideally allow for regular updates of these rates.
- **Skill-Based Rates:** The provided data is general. For accurate bidding, the app should consider different skill levels and trades (e.g., skilled vs. unskilled labor, specialized trades like electricians, plumbers, etc.).
- **On-Cost Mark-up:** The rates mentioned often do not include the on-cost mark-up for profit and attendance by the Main Contractor, which should be factored into the bid engine.

This information provides a foundational dataset for the app's Project Bid Engine, allowing for initial cost estimates based on regional labor rates.
