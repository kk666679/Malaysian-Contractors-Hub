# Route Alignment Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to align all routes in the Malaysian MEP Contractors Hub application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Centralized Route Configuration

Created a central route configuration file at `/src/lib/routeConfig.js` that serves as a single source of truth for all application routes. This file includes:

- Constants for all application routes
- Navigation configurations for the header
- Service and feature definitions with their respective routes

### 2. Component Updates

Updated the following components to use the centralized route configuration:

- **Header.jsx**: 
  - Updated navigation links
  - Updated CTA buttons

- **Footer.jsx**: 
  - Fixed service links to match route definitions
  - Updated feature links
  - Updated contact and policy links

- **ServicesPage.jsx**:
  - Updated service card links
  - Updated contact button link

- **HomePage.jsx**:
  - Updated CTA buttons
  - Fixed feature links to ensure they match defined routes

### 3. Route Validation Tools

Created tools to help maintain route consistency:

- **Route Validator**: Created a utility at `/src/lib/routeValidator.js` to validate routes
- **Validation Script**: Added a script at `/scripts/validate-routes.js` to check all routes in the application
- **Documentation**: Created a routing guide at `/Documentation/ROUTING-GUIDE.md`

## Fixed Issues

1. **Mismatched Service Routes**: Fixed inconsistencies between service routes in the Footer and the actual route definitions:
   - Changed `/services/civil` to `/services/civil-engineering`
   - Changed `/services/electrical` to `/services/electrical-systems`
   - Changed `/services/sewerage` to `/services/sewerage-drainage`
   - Changed `/services/elv` to `/services/elv-systems`
   - Changed `/services/acmv` to `/services/acmv-systems`

2. **Feature Link Consistency**: Ensured feature links in the HomePage component correctly map to their respective routes

3. **Route Reference Consistency**: Replaced hardcoded route strings with references to the centralized route constants

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Routes are now defined in a single location, making them easier to update
2. **Consistency**: All components reference the same route definitions
3. **Error Prevention**: The validation tools help catch routing errors before they cause issues
4. **Documentation**: The routing guide provides clear guidelines for managing routes

## Next Steps

1. Run the route validation script regularly to ensure route consistency
2. Update the route configuration when adding new routes
3. Follow the guidelines in the routing guide when working with routes
