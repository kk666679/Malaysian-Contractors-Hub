# CIDB (Construction Industry Development Board) Standards

The Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) in Malaysia plays a crucial role in regulating and developing the construction industry. Key aspects related to CIDB standards and compliance include:

## CIDB Act 520
- Established under the Construction Industry Development Board Act 1994 (Act 520), CIDB's mandate is to promote and stimulate the development, improvement, and expansion of the construction industry.
- The Act outlines CIDB's functions, including contractor registration, accreditation of skilled workers, and regulating the conformance of standards for construction workmanship and materials.
- Amendments to Act 520, such as in 2011, have introduced additional provisions, including requirements for building materials to receive certification.

## Construction Industry Standard (CIS)
- CIDB develops and reviews Construction Industry Standards (CIS) documents, which serve as voluntary industry codes. These standards set out requirements and best practices for various aspects of construction work.
- Examples of CIS documents include those related to safety and health management (e.g., CIS 10:2020), building workmanship rating (e.g., CIS 7:2021), and fall prevention at construction sites (e.g., CIS 15:2019).
- These standards are developed with the assistance of technical committees and aim to enhance the competitiveness and productivity of the construction industry.

## Contractor Certification and Requirements
- CIDB is responsible for certifying contractors, ensuring they meet specific standards in terms of capability, financial strength, and technical qualifications.
- Contractors are categorized into different grades (e.g., G1 to G7), each with specific requirements for paid-up capital, technical personnel, and experience.
- Compliance with Act 520 and adherence to CIS documents are essential for contractors operating in Malaysia.

For the app, the focus will be on integrating these regulatory frameworks by providing pre-configured templates that align with CIDB's requirements and offering mechanisms for automatic updates to reflect changes in Malaysian MS/ISO building codes and other relevant standards.
