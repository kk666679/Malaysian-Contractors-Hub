# Malaysian Civil & MEP Contractors App: Application Architecture

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the proposed application architecture for the Malaysian Civil & MEP Contractors App. The app aims to provide a comprehensive solution for contractors in Malaysia, incorporating regulatory compliance, project management, and specialized features tailored to the local construction industry. The architecture is designed to be scalable, modular, and robust, supporting both mobile and web platforms.

## 2. High-Level Architecture Overview
The application will follow a microservices-based architecture, separating concerns into independent services that communicate via APIs. This approach enhances scalability, maintainability, and allows for independent development and deployment of modules. The app will consist of three main layers:

1.  **Frontend Layer:** User interfaces for mobile (iOS/Android) and web applications.
2.  **Backend Services Layer:** Core business logic, data processing, and API endpoints.
3.  **Data Layer:** Databases for storing application data, including regulatory information, project details, and user data.


## 3. Core Functional Modules and Their Architectural Considerations

### A. Regulatory Compliance Module
This module will be responsible for managing and providing access to Malaysian-specific regulatory standards and templates. It will ensure that contractors can easily access and apply the latest compliance requirements from various bodies.

**Key Components:**
-   **Regulatory Database:** Stores pre-configured templates and standards for IWK, TM, JKR, CIDB, and Malaysian MS/ISO building codes. This database will be designed for easy updates.
-   **Update Mechanism:** A system to automatically fetch and update the latest Malaysian MS/ISO building codes and other regulatory changes. This might involve web scraping or direct API integrations with relevant government bodies if available.
-   **Compliance Checker:** A sub-module that can validate project plans or bids against selected regulatory templates, highlighting areas of non-compliance.

**Architectural Considerations:**
-   **Data Source Integration:** Prioritize official APIs from IWK, TM, JKR, CIDB, and relevant standards bodies for automatic updates. If APIs are not available, consider web scraping with robust error handling and human verification for critical updates.
-   **Version Control:** Implement a versioning system for regulatory templates to track changes and allow users to revert to previous versions if needed.
-   **Search and Filter:** Efficient search and filtering capabilities within the regulatory database to quickly find relevant standards.

### B. Service Catalog Manager
This module will provide a dynamic database of MEP domains and optional scopes, allowing contractors to manage their service offerings and filter by specific categories.

**Key Components:**
-   **Service Database:** Stores detailed information about various Civil and MEP services, including descriptions, typical scopes, and associated regulatory requirements.
-   **Categorization and Filtering Engine:** Enables users to filter services by Civil (Earthworks, Piling, Drainage), Electrical (Solar/Smart Grid, Gensets), Sewerage (IWK-approved systems), ELV (CCTV, Access Control), and other optional scopes.

**Architectural Considerations:**
-   **Flexible Schema:** The service database schema should be flexible enough to accommodate new MEP domains and optional scopes without requiring significant architectural changes.
-   **Indexing:** Implement efficient indexing for fast filtering and search operations.

### C. Project Bid Engine
This module will automate the generation of cost estimates, incorporating Malaysian-specific material costs and labor rates.

**Key Components:**
