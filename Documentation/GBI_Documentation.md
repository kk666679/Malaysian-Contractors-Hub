# Green Building Index (GBI) Documentation in Malaysia

The Green Building Index (GBI) is Malaysia's recognized green rating system for evaluating the environmental design and performance of buildings. It promotes sustainability in the built environment and is developed by the Malaysia Green Building Confederation (MGBC).

## Key Criteria for GBI Certification:
GBI assessment is based on six main criteria:
1.  **Energy Efficiency (EE):** Focuses on optimizing energy consumption in buildings.
2.  **Indoor Environment Quality (IEQ):** Addresses factors like thermal comfort, acoustics, and visual comfort.
3.  **Material Resources (MR):** Emphasizes the use of sustainable and recycled materials, and responsible waste management.
4.  **Sustainable Site Planning & Management (SM):** Covers aspects like site selection, public transport access, and storm water management.
5.  **Water Efficiency (WE):** Promotes efficient water usage and rainwater harvesting.
6.  **Innovation (IN):** Recognizes innovative design and construction practices that go beyond the standard requirements.

## GBI Rating System:
Buildings are certified based on the score obtained, with different levels of certification:
-   **Certified:** 50 to 65 points
-   **Silver:** 66 to 75 points
-   **Gold:** 76 to 85 points
-   **Platinum:** 86 to 100 points

## Documentation and Compliance:
-   GBI certification requires submission of application forms and supporting documents. These documents detail how the project meets the criteria across the six assessment areas.
-   Compliance with GBI standards often involves adherence to other Malaysian standards (e.g., for materials) and best practices in sustainable construction.

For the app, the Compliance Tracker module will include a checklist generator for GBI documentation, allowing contractors to track their progress against these criteria and prepare necessary submissions for GBI certification.
