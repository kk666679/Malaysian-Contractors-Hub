# IWK Sewerage Standards

## Effluent Standards (ES)
Domestic sewage treatment aims to produce effluent low in solids and organic matter. Additional treatments may be added to remove nutrients, alter pH, or disinfect effluent depending on the receiving environment.

Standards are set for effluent quality discharged into receiving waters, taking the form of acceptable upper limits for various contaminants. Effluent from treatment plants is regularly sampled and tested to ensure compliance and efficient operation.

## Population Equivalent (PE)
To design pipe networks, pump stations, and sewage treatment plants, estimates of volumetric flow rate are needed for both existing land use and future development.

One method to calculate expected flow rates is to determine the "population equivalent" (PE) of a catchment and convert it to a flow rate. PE estimates the usage of sewerage facilities and is not a direct measure of population.

For residential areas, PE is calculated as five per dwelling, directly reflecting the population. For commercial areas, it is calculated from the floor area, which is considered proportional to the number of people using the premises during the day.
